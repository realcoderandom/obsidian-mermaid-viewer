# Architecture

`src/main.ts` composes the plugin. Obsidian renders Mermaid; the viewer decorates and clones the generated SVG. The only external runtime module is `obsidian`.

| Module                             | Responsibility                                                               |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `settings-model.ts`, `settings.ts` | Scope validation, persistence and settings UI                                |
| `integration/note-observer.ts`     | Eligible diagrams, inline controls and reversible cleanup                    |
| `diagram/metadata.ts`              | Note and heading metadata through the public View API                        |
| `viewer/modal.ts`                  | Modal lifecycle and module coordination                                      |
| `viewer/camera.ts`                 | Pure zoom, pan and fit geometry                                              |
| `viewer/input.ts`                  | Mouse, keyboard, wheel, touch and pointer cleanup                            |
| `viewer/ui.ts`                     | Controls, help and legends                                                   |
| `viewer/svg-viewport.ts`           | Fixed inner SVG and outer camera viewport                                    |
| `theme/`                           | Generic semantic roles and reversible SVG styling                            |
| `styles.css`                       | Light surfaces, inline cards, Live Preview integration and fullscreen layout |

## Invariants

1. Camera calculations retain fractional coordinates. The zoom anchor stays at the same screen position.
2. Zoom changes only the outer SVG viewBox; the original SVG dimensions and HTML label layout remain fixed.
3. The light surface opts out of the host's dark-mode inversion.
4. Scope accepts an empty string or one CSS class, never an arbitrary selector.
5. Decoration removes only its own controls, `mpv-` classes and `data-mpv-*` attributes. Note text is never changed.
6. Observers, pointers, event listeners and animation frames are cleaned up on disposal.
7. Obsidian Scope handles Escape: close help before closing the viewer.
8. Node colors depend on semantic classes, not labels or application-specific names.
9. Initial camera layout is synchronous. Paused background animation frames must not leave an uninitialized viewport.
10. Live Preview overrides apply only to a host containing an owned `.mermaid.mpv-note-diagram` and `.mpv-mermaid-embed` classes. Native source-edit actions keep their original behavior.

## Verification

- Unit tests exercise camera geometry, scope normalization and semantic roles.
- Browser tests exercise the built bundle with the API mock in `tests/helpers/`.
- Theme tests check contrast, actor bounds and host-theme invariance. Integration checks cover exact style restoration, concurrent DOM edits, scoped hover styling and searchable settings.
- Source and CSS lint reject direct style assignments, deprecated active-leaf access, global animation frames, native DOM creation, forced CSS overrides and broad parent selectors.
- CSS is bundled from `styles.css` and `src/theme/svg.css` into `dist/styles.css`, which Obsidian loads. Runtime code adds no style elements. Inline palette normalization reads these loaded rules and restores original declarations on cleanup.
- Release tests reject missing, stale or unsupported assets. The release workflow attests the three install assets and verifies downloaded bytes and provenance before publishing.
- `docs/examples/*.mmd` are the source of both SVG fixtures and documentation screenshots. Regenerate with `npm run build` and `npm run docs:images`.
- A real Obsidian installation remains necessary for host integration checks.

Flowcharts and sequence diagrams have the broadest coverage. Other diagram types keep their internal styles when their structure is unrecognized. Pop-out windows, embedded Canvas surfaces, the declared minimum app version and mobile devices need dedicated verification before being advertised as supported.
